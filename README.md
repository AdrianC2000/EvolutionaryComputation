# Classical genetic algorithm

## TODO list
1. Binary chromosome representation :white_check_mark:
2. Selection methods:
   * Best selection
   * Tournament Selection
   * Roulette Wheel Selection
3. Crossover methods:
   * Single-point
   * Two-point
   * Three-point
   * Uniform
   * Grain
   * Methods from project I
4. Mutation:
   * Boundary
   * Single-point
   * Two-point
5. Inversion operator
6. Elitism strategy
7. Configurable variables:
   * Variables number in fitness function
   * Population size
   * Epochs number
   * Binary chromosome representation precision :white_check_mark:
   * Selection methods parameters
   * Crossover probability
   * Mutation probability
   * Inversion probability
   * Elitism strategy - percentage or number of individuals passing to the next population
